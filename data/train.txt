__label__other Patent Transactions and Strategic Counseling Develop your strategy. Realize your rewards. In today’s fast-moving global market, innovations in technology and science afford companies of all sizes a competitive advantage. But innovation itself is not enough. Managing the underlying intellectual property becomes a critical part of business strategy. In fact, the IP strategy of a business can determine how products are developed, whether new markets are entered, and, in some cases, whether an enterprise even succeeds. Survey the landscape. Identify opportunities. Innovative start-ups, multinational corporations, and other IP-driven organizations turn to Finnegan for guidance when considering their IP options. We work with each client’s business, legal, and technical staffs to develop IP portfolios that align with their business objectives. We assess existing and developing portfolios to ensure that business plans are built on and around products based on strong IP protection that avoid infringement. This often entails identifying and prioritizing assets with recommendations to license technologies or sell marginal assets to generate revenue, to donate or even abandon assets to reduce costs, and to identify acquisitions to strengthen or expand an existing portfolio. Due diligence. Assess risks. Move forward with confidence. In fast-moving, high-pressure mergers, acquisitions, partnering, and investment transactions, obtaining an accurate and comprehensive intellectual property evaluation is critical. The possible outcome of pending or potential litigation, the assignability of a company’s IP agreements, and the scope and ownership of IP rights are just some of the issues to consider. Our deep understanding of varied technologies and mastery of IP law allow us to help companies react quickly to any issue that emerges during an IP transaction, to provide thoughtful and accurate answers to investors’ questions, and to craft contract terms that properly allocate risks. We deliver highly targeted and sophisticated analyses of the IP assets at issue that can help drive an equitable deal. We have conducted successful due diligence on matters as complex as the Exxon–Mobil merger, and as focused as an analysis of in-license agreements of an innovative biotech start-up that was being considered for later-round funding. Our size, technical background, and experience allow us to assemble and mobilize a well-matched team that quickly identifies key issues, proposes options for mitigating risks, and outlines a strategy for strengthening our client’s bargaining position. Ideally, due diligence investigations are conducted at the onset of negotiations, allowing time for a reasoned analysis of the value of the IP portfolio and time for corrective action to address issues that may influence the deal. Mine and map your portfolio Unlocking and understanding your assets in a larger context can reveal your position in the market and expose roadblocks to maneuver around and opportunities for moving forward with confidence. We utilize our technical skills to search prior art, literature, and relevant patents around the globe. Our mapping techniques enable us to outline the applicable information in a highly accessible and easily understood format. But there is no substitute for knowledge and experience when interpreting the data and how it can be used to shape your IP business strategy within the context of the market. We help you understand the strength and breadth of your patents and whether obstacles are something to challenge or to design around. When you are facing a bet-the-company decision, this insight is vital to your success. Evaluate your IP assets through opinions and counseling We render hundreds of opinions a year ranging from a single opinion on a specific patent to providing long-term, ongoing counseling on complex patent portfolios or litigation. We routinely address patent validity, enforceability, misuse, design-around issues, licensing potential, IP contract construction and enforcement, and export controls. We regularly partner with our clients’ legal, business, and technical staffs to identify the potential for risk and reward, from idea to revenue-generating portfolios. In addition to transactional counseling, we routinely advise clients on prelitigation strategies. Our extensive litigation experience gives us firsthand insight into the various types of arguments opponents may raise. Combining our litigation and IP transactional experience allows us to help guide our clients to favorable settlements of disputes before or during litigation. Generate value through licensing, pooling, and other transactions Leveraging patents, trade secrets, or portions of an IP portfolio can often generate revenue streams, open new markets, or shut down competitors. We have advised leading corporations and other innovative companies in virtually every type of IP-related transaction. We have helped clients set up and run licensing programs that have generated significant revenue streams, and we have worked with clients to pool patents and deal with standards issues. Our legal and technical experience and our background in the business of exploiting technology and IP assets bring our clients a strategic advantage. IP transactions, often global in nature, require a business-savvy partner with legal and technical expertise. Transactions may be simple licenses for income or complex strategic alliances providing product and market access to both parties. We can analyze the potential for generating royalty income from existing IP rights, then formulate and execute licensing programs to help you realize full revenue potential. We advise on everything in a transaction program, from the initial confidential evaluation agreement through management of the portfolio of executed IP agreements. As business relationships evolve, we assist in enforcing or amending obligations in those agreements. Finnegan is a pioneer in the development of IP licensing. Our lawyers have played an instrumental role in the establishment and ongoing management of the Licensing Executives Society (LES), and continue to serve in leadership roles in LES (USA and Canada) and LESI (International). We are recognized authorities in IP transactions law and serve as adjunct professors and contributing authors to licensing and transactional publications. Export control and regulatory guidance Developing an international patent strategy requires careful navigation of shifting regulatory and administrative requirements of trade and export controls. The reach is broad, affecting U.S. companies or organizations that export materials, software, and technologies, as well as non-U.S. companies that may utilize such exports in products of their own. In the current global environment, the trend is toward aggressive enforcement, and the penalties are severe. Playing by the rules is essential. A failure to understand the nuances could mean losing access to key markets and the potential of fines and prosecutions through inadvertent violation of export regulations. Finnegan brings highly focused experience in this specialized area. With our extensive resources, we are well positioned to guide you through the complex maze of U.S. regulations governing the export of materials, software, or technology and even the transfer of knowledge. We regularly advise clients on export regulations, provide opinions on classifications, apply for licenses or license exceptions, and, should the need arise, litigate enforcement actions. Innovative companies recognize the opportunities the U.S. government provides to reach new markets and increase revenue. But this collaboration is often characterized by unique legal nuances and complexities when it comes to protecting your IP. For example, your proprietary information might be inadvertently released through the Freedom of Information Act. To protect yourself, you need a firm with experience, a firm that knows the current law as well as its evolution, and that understands where red tape may stall progress. Finnegan has represented and worked with many federal agencies and departments—including virtually every federal research funding agency. As research and development expenditures soar, public–private research has become an increasingly attractive vehicle for funding innovative research. Finnegan can help protect your interests as you obtain grants or work with national laboratories and funding agencies to research innovative solutions.

__label__math # 微积分网课代修|积分学代写Integral Calculus代考|MA1030C Larger exceptional sets  • 单变量微积分 • 多变量微积分 • 傅里叶级数 • 黎曼积分 • ODE • 微分学  ## 微积分作业代写calclulus代考|Larger exceptional sets  As integration theory developed over the centuries since Newton it became clear that the theory required quite large exceptional sets, certainly larger than just a few points. But this also requires us to characterize those sets that can be so neglected and also to describe what we must require of an indefinite integral so that these sets can be ignored.  At a calculus level we can easily go one step further, even if we cannot quite approach the full generality needed. The key is to push Lemma $1.2$ and Lemma $1.3$ much further. We cannot do this with help from the mean-value theorem as before: indeed the proof is deferred to the next chapter where we introduce a new technique needed for the integration theory.  LEMMA 1.5. Suppose that $F$ and $G$ are both continuous functions on an interval $[a, b]$. Suppose that there is a sequence of points $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, \ldots$ of points from $[a, b]$ and that $F^{\prime}(x)=G^{\prime}(x)$ for all $a<x<b$ except possibly at the points $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$, … Then $$F(b)-F(a)=G(b)-G(a)$$  ## 微积分作业代写calclulus代考|A version of the Newton integral for elementary calculus  Assuming Lemma $1.5$ for the moment we can introduce a much improved version of the Newton integral.  Definition $1.6$ (Modified Newton Integral). Suppose that $f$ is a function defined on an interval $(a, b)$ except possibly at the points of a sequence $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$, .. from $[a, b]$. Suppose that we can find a continuous function $F:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ so that $F^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$ for every $x$ with $a<x<b$ with perhaps the exception of the points $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, \ldots$. Then we will say that $F$ is an indefinite integral of $f$ on $[a, b]$ and we will write $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x=F(b)-F(a)$$ and call the latter the definite integral of $f$ on $[a, b]$. The only justification needed would be to use Lemma $1.5$ to check that if $F$ and $G$ both qualify to be indefinite integrals of $f$ on an interval $[a, b]$, then $F$ and $G$ differ by a constant so that $F(b)-F(a)=G(b)-G(a)$. Thus the definite integral is unambiguously defined.  There is one subtle point here that might be missed. Suppose that two functions $F$ and $G$ both qualify to be indefinite integrals of $f$. That means that there is some sequence of points $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, \ldots$ from $[a, b]$ and that $F^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$ provided $x$ is not one of the points in this sequence. It also means that there is some sequence of points $e_{1}^{\prime}, e_{2}^{\prime}, e_{3}^{\prime}, \ldots$ from $[a, b]$ [not necessarily the same sequence as before] and that $G^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$ provided $x$ is not one of the points in this sequence.  Accordingly, we observe that $F^{\prime}(x)=G^{\prime}(x)$ except possibly at points belonging to the combined sequence $$e_{1}, e_{1}^{\prime}, e_{2}, e_{2}^{\prime}, e_{3}, e_{3}^{\prime}, e_{4}, e_{4}^{\prime}, \ldots$$allowing us to apply Lemma 1.5. From that lemma we deduce that $F$ and $G$ differ by a constant and that $F(b)-F(a)=G(b)-G(a)$. Thus the definite integral is unambiguously defined no matter what indefinite integral we choose to use.  ## 微积分作业代写calclulus代考|Larger exceptional sets  $$F(b)-F(a)=G(b)-G(a)$$  ## 微积分作业代写calclulus代考|A version of the Newton integral for elementary calculus  $F^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$ 对于每个 $x$ 和 $a<x<b$ 也许除了点 $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, \ldots$. 然后我们会说 $F$ 是 一个不定积分 $f$ 上 $[a, b]$ 我们会写 $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x=F(b)-F(a)$$  $$e_{1}, e_{1}^{\prime}, e_{2}, e_{2}^{\prime}, e_{3}, e_{3}^{\prime}, e_{4}, e_{4}^{\prime}, \ldots$$

__label__math Overrelaxation with w < 0  Are there any circumstances under which using a value $$w < 0$$ would help us find a solution in over-relaxation faster than we can with the ordinary relaxation method?  Over Relaxation Method:  $$x'= [1 + w]f(x) - wx$$  Example  Calculating $$x = 1-e^{-3x}$$  Take x = 1 as initial value, and w as 0.2  x' = (1+0.2)f(1)-0.2(1) = 0.94025551795  x' = (1+0.2)f(0.94025551795)-0.2(0.94025551795) = 0.94047657354  x' = (1+0.2)f(0.94047657354)-0.2(0.94047657354) = 0.94047974478  x' = (1+0.2)f(0.94047974478)=0.2(0.94047974478) = 0.94047979005   We stop until the value get to a certain accuracy  Why would the over-relaxation reach the solution faster if we consider $$w < 0$$ in non-linear function such as $$x = 1 - e^{(1 - x^2)}$$?  • Cross posted on Physics: physics.stackexchange.com/q/468753/25301 – Kyle Kanos Mar 26 at 14:31 • It seems like you are trying to find the roots of a nonlinear equation using fixed-point iteration. It also seems that you are using the opposite signs for the $w$, compared with the usual convention. I would say that the other sign looks more natural (to me) because it resembles a convex linear combination. – nicoguaro Apr 1 at 15:39
__label__other 3 October, 2012 Free holiday programmes benefit thousands Holiday programmes introduced by the National Government have been enjoyed by more than 65,000 children from high need communities. Breakaway programmes for 11 to 17-year-olds are targeted to young people who wouldn’t normally have access to school holiday programmes. “Young people from stressed families in high-deprivation areas often have little to do in the holidays. We wanted to provide a fun, structured and safe environment for young people to enjoy, which won’t cost their parents a cent.” “I’ve seen children on Breakaway just loving the opportunity to mix with other kids, do exciting activities - sometimes with famous sportspeople - and having fun like children should in the holidays,” says Mrs Bennett. Since being introduced in late 2009 65,218 children have officially attended Breakaway programmes. “Unofficially, we know the numbers are much higher because children often bring their younger siblings along when they are caring for them.” Breakaway programmes have been delivered by community organisations in more than 40 areas including the Far North, South and West Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Masterton, Taupō, Bay of Plenty, Napier, Rotorua, Gisborne, Whakatane, Lower Hutt, Kawerau and Horowhenua. The range of activities on offer includes kayaking, abseiling, art, dance, swimming, kapa haka, sports, martial arts, music and BMX riding. “Community providers do an outstanding job delivering these programmes to children who love it so much they come back every day, usually with a few extras tagging along because word’s gotten around,” says Mrs Bennett. The National Government has funded more than $7 million for Breakaway programmes to date.

__label__math # GitHub Best Practices¶  A basic understanding of Git is key to expanding dnppy, as it is with many other large software packages such as numpy, scipy, gdal and others you may be familiar with. If you’d like an introduction to git, checkout Git Basics. There are are a small set of best practices that should be employed where possible.  ## What to include in a Git repo¶  There are certain files that you might want to store near your development environment, but that you do not want to upload to your repository. Git uses a special file called .gitignore that can be used to ignore specific files or directories in a repository, which allows them to peacefully exist in your local repository without tracking their changes and updating them in the origin on GitHubs website. The .gitignore for dnppy is already set up to ignore several files by name, as well as several files by extension such as .pyc's.  Things to include in your repository: • Any kind of raw text or code. Tracking changes in text is what git was built for! • Helpful description files such as README.md that can be interpreted by GitHub and displayed while browsing. • Small static assets or images that are helpful for documentation purposes that do not frequently change. Things to omit from your git repository • Raster data! you never ever want to include raster data in your online repository, as this data will then be permanently included in your git and dramatically decrease performance in every aspect. • Any kind of fairly constant binary data that github cannot interpret as text. These types of files are best stored in the release assets independent from repository tracking.  ## Committing to the master branch¶  We typically direct people to simply download the most recent version of the master branch. As a general rule, the master branch should always be “deployable”, meaning it should work reliably.  • Simple bug fixes can be committed directly to the master branch. • Commits in which changes to documentation, docstrings, or comments to improve clarity, but preserve function can be committed directly to the master branch.  When adding some kind of new functionality, you should always create a new branch for development and testing. When you are satisfied with the new additions, you can then merge that branch with the master branch with a pull request. Learn more about the GitHub Flow  Note  We started out as noobs, and did not institute proper git workflow with dnppy from the beginning. Nothing terrible happened, but some things were more difficult than they would have been otherwise. Just do your best, and learn as much as you can!  ## Versioning¶  We expect that a new version should be always be released immediately after, and sometimes immediately before every DEVELOP term. This is due in part to the inclusion of the undeployed/proj_code folder and the fact that it needs to be made available for project partners very quickly.  version numbers  The numbering is pretty simple, and takes the format of  [major_revision].[two_digit_year].[minor_revision][beta tag]  The major revision is reserved for very large changes. When dnppy reaches complete arcpy independence or upgrades to use python 3.0, an increase in the major revision number would be justified. It is difficult for us to know what future scenarios may arise, but anything that changes the major revision number should be a pretty big deal. The two digit year is a simple record keeping device to associate a version of dnppy with NASA’s fiscal year, which turns over each September. The minor revision is more or less at your discretion, but should always rise as changes are made. The beta tag is used to say dnppy is still in beta. version changes with bug fixes and other things characteristic of a young software package still in beta can probably use a new digit after the beta tag. so, 1.16.1b0 to 1.16.1b1, and so on. Eventually we should drop the beta tag and exit the “beta” phase.  Example revision schedule: • dnppy 1.16.1b0 Fall 2015, at the beginning of FY16 • dnppy 1.16.1b1 Bug fixes in 1b0 • dnppy 1.16.2b0 Miscellaneous update that required new version number • dnppy 1.16.2b1 Fall 2015, end of the term update with new proj_code for partners • dnppy 1.16.4b0 Spring 2016, mid term fixes of something • dnppy 1.16.5b0 Spring 2016, end of the term update with new proj_code for partners • ... • dnppy 1.17.1b0 Fall 2016, beginning of FY17
